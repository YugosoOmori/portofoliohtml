<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello I am Mario, a student at the moment and I love programming since I was little. I'm not really a big fan of learning for school projects or doing homework but I surely love coding and listening to music. As a normal teenager I like to have my own money and not ask my parents for it everytime so I decided to try to get a job and found one in construction that I really love.</p>
